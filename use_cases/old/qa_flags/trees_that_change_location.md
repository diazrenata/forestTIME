# Trees changing location (by CN)

There are 888 trees with PREV_TRE_CN links that would take them across
plot/state/county/unit boundaries. Most of the time (857 times) they
occur in multiple counties; occasionally it’s plot (31). It’s never
state, and never unit without also being county. They are in the
following 9 states:

| STATE_NAME     |   n |
